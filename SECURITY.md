# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities **privately** through GitHub's
built-in **Private Vulnerability Reporting**:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability** and fill out the advisory form.

If private reporting is unavailable for some reason, email
**contactmukundthiru@gmail.com** with:

- Affected version / commit SHA
- Reproduction steps and proof-of-concept (where safe to share)
- Impact assessment

You will receive an acknowledgement within **5 business days**.
Coordinated-disclosure timeline is up to **90 days** from
acknowledgement; we will notify you before the patch ships.

## Supported Versions

Only the `main` branch (and the latest published crate / package
release) receives security fixes. Vendored snapshots and forks are
responsible for backporting.

## Out of Scope

- Findings against archived branches or deprecated tags.
- Self-XSS or social-engineering attacks against maintainers.
- Reports that depend on a compromised upstream package without a
  reproducible downstream impact.

## Coordinated Disclosure

GHSA advisories are filed under the appropriate Santh GitHub
organization. We coordinate CVE assignment via GitHub's CNA when a
fix ships.

## RustSec Advisory Assessment (v0.5.3)

A `cargo audit` of `Cargo.lock` surfaces six advisories (3 vulnerability,
3 informational). Each was reviewed against keyhog's actual usage of
the affected crate and given an explicit accept-with-rationale decision
or a fix path. The accepts are reflected in the `[advisories]` ignore
list at the workspace-root `audit.toml`; `cargo audit` exits clean with
that file in place.

### Accepted (rationale-documented)

#### RUSTSEC-2023-0071 — `rsa 0.9.7` Marvin attack

**Risk:** PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA decryption is timing-sidechannel-vulnerable
(Marvin attack); an attacker with a decryption oracle can recover a key.

**Why not applicable:** `crates/verifier/src/oob/client.rs` uses ONLY
`rsa::Oaep` for decryption (`use rsa::{Oaep, RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey}`).
PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption code paths are not invoked. Even if the rsa
crate's PKCS#1 v1.5 implementation has timing leaks, keyhog never
exercises them.

**Threat-model gate:** the OOB verifier is a client, not a server. We
generate a keypair, share the public half with the InteractSh server,
and decrypt server-pushed payloads locally. There is no remote
decryption oracle exposed by keyhog.

#### RUSTSEC-2026-0002 — `lru 0.12.5` IterMut Stacked Borrows violation

**Risk:** `LruCache::iter_mut()` invalidates an internal pointer
(detectable by Miri's Stacked Borrows checker).

**Why not applicable:** `crates/scanner/src/multiline/fragment_cache.rs`
uses `lru::LruCache::get_or_insert_mut()` and `cluster.iter_mut()` on
its own `Vec<SecretFragment>`, not on `LruCache::iter_mut()`. The
unsound API isn't called.

#### RUSTSEC-2026-0097 — `rand 0.8.5` unsound with custom logger

**Risk:** `rand::rng()` interaction with custom `tracing` logger has a
data race when the global rng is replaced.

**Why not applicable:** keyhog does not replace the global rng. `rand`
is pulled transitively via `num-bigint-dig` → `rsa`; both use only the
default `OsRng` seed path. Our tracing logger does not call into rand.

#### RUSTSEC-2024-0436 — `paste 1.0.15` unmaintained

**Risk:** crate is unmaintained; future advisories will not get fixes.

**Why not applicable now:** `paste` is a proc-macro used at compile
time; it produces no runtime code in keyhog binaries. An unmaintained
proc-macro can't introduce runtime CVEs. We will migrate when a
suitable replacement appears in our transitive dep tree.

### Pending (real fixes required, tracked)

#### RUSTSEC-2025-0140 — `gix-date 0.9.4` non-utf8 String construction

**Risk:** A malicious commit with a non-UTF-8 timestamp string can
trigger UB through `TimeBuf::as_str`.

**Status:** Not yet fixed in keyhog. Fix requires bumping `gix` from
the pinned `=0.70.0` to a version that pulls `gix-date >= 0.12.0`
(approximately `gix >= 0.71`), which is a non-trivial dependency
update across the git source crate. Tracked for v0.6.0.

**Mitigation in v0.5.3:** keyhog's git source consumes commits via
`gix::ObjectId::from_hex`, `gix::find_object`, and tree walks. Where
commit timestamps are surfaced, they enter `Arc<str>` via `to_string`
which would panic before reaching `TimeBuf::as_str`. The attack
surface is narrow but not zero — operators scanning untrusted
repositories should not run keyhog in a production-credential
environment until v0.6.0.

#### RUSTSEC-2025-0021 — `gix-features 0.40.0` SHA-1 collision attacks

**Risk:** `gix-features` does not detect SHA-1 collisions in git
objects (Severity 6.8 / medium). An attacker with the ability to
inject a colliding object into a target repository could
mis-attribute or hide a leaked secret.

**Status:** Not yet fixed in keyhog. Same root cause as above — needs
the `gix` upgrade. Tracked for v0.6.0.

**Mitigation in v0.5.3:** keyhog's secret detection runs against
file CONTENT, not git OID identity. A SHA-1 collision can let an
attacker swap one tree object for another with identical SHA-1 — the
content of the swapped object would still be scanned and reported
unless the attacker can ALSO craft content that suppresses keyhog's
match (a much harder constraint). The realistic impact is incomplete
git-history coverage, not undetected leaks in current files.
